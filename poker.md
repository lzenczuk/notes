## Probability and money
Gether all outcomes and calculate win probablity.
Profit expectation = (Profit x Probability of Profit) + (Loss x Probability of Loss)

In example 1: Coins game. +1$ win, -1$ lose.
```
Profit expectation = (1 x 0.5) + (-1 x 0.5) = 0
```

In example 2: Coins game. +1$ win, -0.9$ lose.
```
Profit expectation = (1 x 0.5) + (-0.9 x 0.5) = 0.05
```
If you play game 100 times you should statistically make 5$.

Edge is a positive profit expectation.
